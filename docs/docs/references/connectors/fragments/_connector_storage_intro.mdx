- _Local storage_, which includes [_ConnectorMetadata_](../README.mdx#connectormetadata) and [_type_](../README.mdx#connector-type), is an object containing fixed properties such as logo, connector platform, and so on. (:face_with_monocle: Having trouble understanding these properties? No worry, a detailed explanation comes later!)
- _Remote storage_ is stored in [DB](../README.mdx#connector-db) for the sake of relatively frequent changes on those data.
