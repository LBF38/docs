This service may collect and analyze non-personally identifiable information such as user behaviors, device information, and usage patterns. The information collected by Application Insights is used solely for the purpose of improving our services.\\n\\nFor more information on how Microsoft collects and uses data through Application Insights, please refer to [Data collection, retention, and storage in Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/data-retention-privacy).\\n\\n## About Google user data\\n\\n### Access to Google user data\\n\\nLogto only accesses Google user data with explicit user consent. When a user signs up for Logto, they grant us access to certain Google account information, such as name, email address, and profile picture.\\n\\n### Use of Google user data\\n\\nLogto uses Google user data solely for the purpose of providing our services to the user. This includes enabling the user to sign in to our app, and providing access to necessary features within Logto Cloud.\\n\\n### Storage of Google user data\\n\\nLogto stores Google user data on secure servers located in data centers within the West Europe region. Please refer to the [Data Security](#data-security) section for more information on how we ensure the safety and security of user data.\\n\\n### Sharing of Google user data\\n\\nLogto does not share Google user data with any third parties, except as required by law or to comply with legal process.

Secure Communication: The communication between any public party to Logto services is enforced by [TLS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) (Transport Layer Security) to ensure that all data transmitted between you and our service is encrypted and secure.\\n2. Private Database Network: The Logto database stays in a private network in the [Azure West Europe region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#choose-your-region), with no direct access to the public internet. This ensures that your data is stored in a secure and protected environment.\\n3. Data Isolation: Every tenant has a dedicated database role and every business table has enforced [Row-Level Security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ddl-rowsecurity.html) to ensure that your data is isolated in the database. This means that only authorized users have access to the data, and each tenant\'s data is separated from other tenants.\\n4. Password Encryption: Logto will not store passwords in plain text. All passwords are encrypted using the [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) algorithm, which is a secure password hashing algorithm. This ensures that even if a data breach were to occur, your password would not be compromised.\\n\\nWe regularly review our security practices and update them as necessary to ensure that your personal information is protected. If you have any questions or concerns about the security of your personal information, please contact us at [security@logto.io](mailto:security@logto.io).\\n\\n## Changes to this Privacy Policy\\n\\nWe may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
